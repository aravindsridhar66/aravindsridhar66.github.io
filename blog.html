                Today I thought that it would be really cool if I wrote a blog to document me currently and watch how I 
                grow through the different stages of my life.  As a young adult, I realize that I might not have the feelings that I am currently
                having in future stages of my life.  How better to capture them than through writing, a direct representation
                of what I think and feel.  So today I went to work at the MSK lab and wasn't really doing much so I thought it
                would be kind of important to have my own website on my resume... So here I am.  I'm pretty bad at writing so
                I hope that this makes be better.  <br> <br>

                Anyways:
                <br> <br>
                Shout out to my dude Giovanni Walker for having his 2nd Album being released this Wednesday!  I'm so proud 
                of him and can't wait to listen to it. <br> <br> http://gprophecy.com/
