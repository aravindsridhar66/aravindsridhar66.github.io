                Today I thought that it would be really cool if I had a way to document me, and my life, through my own perspective. 
                As a young adult, I realize that I won't always have the feelings, ambitions, and philosophies, that I have currently.
                How better to capture them than through writing - a direct representation
                of ME.  When I was at work today, (and had some down time) I thought it
                would be kind of important to have my own website on my resume... So I created this in a day! 
                <br>
                SkillS I used/learned: HTML, CSS, BootStrap (this one is awesome), github webhosting, and my new favorite editor - Visual Studio Code
                <br><br>
                In addition to the reasons above, I added this blog in order to practice my shitty writing.
                I hope to share both personal and professional experiences that impact my life.   <br> <br>

                Anyways:
                <br> <br>
                Shout out to my dude Giovanni Walker for having his 2nd Album being released this Wednesday!  I'm so proud 
                of him and can't wait to listen to it. <br> <br> http://gprophecy.com/
